# 74HCT6526 
The 74HCT6526 is a very amateur attempt at building a MOS6526 replica using discrete logic. This repo is publicly shared just for educational purposes, and I can offer no guarantee on the correct behaviour of this implementation. So far, it's working great for me, but I can't promise anything.

# Versioning
74HCT6526 is released under the following versioning scheme:

MAJOR.MINOR.REVISION

For a stack to work properly, is mandatory that all boards share the MAJOR.MINOR versi√≥n. Any change than renders a board incompatible with the previous releases triggers a new MINOR version. If a version only includes fixes, but does not alter the buses, it's only a new revision.

Under the current scheme, I don't think I'll ever need a new MAJOR version, but it is nice to have it there, just in case.

# Manufacturing
All boards are tested against JLCPCB and PCBWAY capabilities. For PCBWAY, there is no increase in cost compared to the standard 4 layer board.

# Releases
* v0.1.0  First production run. Only includes B0 (DDR and PORTs)
* v0.1.0a First production run for B1. (TIMERA and CREGA)
* v0.1.1  Second production run for B1. Fixes TASTART issue. First B2 (TIMERB and CREGB) 
* v0.1.2  First production run for B3. (SDR and ICR)
* v0.2.0  First MINOR advance. B0+B1+B2+B3 tested and validated.
