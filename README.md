# 74HCT6526 
The 74HCT6526 is a very amateur attempt at building a MOS6526 replica using discrete logic. This repo is publicly shared just for educational purposes, and I can offer no guarantee on the correct behaviour of this implementation.
Even though the project begun back in July 2018, it's currently going through a full reboot. The older implementation is no longer public, and I'm sharing my new design even though it's being implemented right now.
